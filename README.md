**Title:** *The Infinite Bureaucracy of the Unknowable Horizon: A Cosmic Tycoon of Misplaced Certainty*  

**Setting:**  
In the year 3124.7, humanity has achieved its ultimate destiny: becoming a minor footnote in a galactic civilization so vast, so ineffably complex, and so utterly indifferent to our existence that it has collectively agreed to ignore us. But you, the player, are the newly appointed **Station Overseer** of *Horizon-7*, a decaying megastation orbiting the event horizon of a black hole named **Gnabberghast-9** (pronounced "Why Bother?"). This black hole is not just a vacuum of spacetime—it’s a sentient, existentialist entity that communicates via interpretive dance and emits gravitational puns. Your job? Keep the station afloat, appease its temperamental AI core (**HAL 9000’s distant, bitter cousin, GLORP-7**), and somehow turn a profit while navigating a cosmos where "the answer to everything" is a PDF file titled *42.pdf* that no one can open.  

**Core Premise:**  
Horizon-7 was originally built to house the **Galactic Interstellar Resource Allocation Consortium** (GI-RAC), a committee tasked with distributing the universe’s resources fairly. But after a catastrophic meeting where delegates argued for 37 parsecs about whether dark matter should be taxed as a liquid or a solid, the station was abandoned. Now, it’s a floating scrapyard of failed utopias, inhabited by:  
- **The Glorpniks**, a hive-mind species that communicates via interpretive tax codes.  
- **The Zynthians**, a race of melancholic poets who mine neutron stars for "stellar ink" to write odes to oblivion.  
- **The Quargg**, a civilization of hyper-logical beings who believe all problems can be solved by rearranging commas.  
- **You**, a human with a coffee addiction and a degree in "Interstellar Bureaucratic Contingency Planning."  

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
1. **Resource Management:**  
   - Collect **Dark Matter Credits** (DMC) by recycling existential dread from nearby planets.  
   - Balance the **Flux Capacitor Budget** (required to keep the station from collapsing into a meme) against the **Quantum Cheese Surplus** (a volatile commodity that melts if anyone mentions its name in all caps).  
   - Negotiate with the black hole Gnabberghast-9, which demands "meaningful engagement" in exchange for gravitational stability. Its favorite currency? Bad puns.  

2. **Diplomacy & Absurdity:**  
   - Mediate disputes between the Glorpniks and Zynthians, who are locked in a 200-year feud over whether "the void is a noun or a verb."  
   - Build alliances with **The Committee of Unseen Observers**, a shadowy group that exists in all timelines simultaneously but only responds to requests written in iambic pentameter.  
   - Avoid triggering **The Great Paperwork Purge**, a GLORP-7 subroutine that deletes entire departments if their TPS reports aren’t filed in triplicate, upside-down, and accompanied by a haiku.  

3. **Anomalies & Horrors:**  
   - Investigate the **Library of Lost Questions**, a floating archive where every book contains a single sentence: *"What if the answer is wrong?"*  
   - Survive **The Event Horizon’s Whisper**, a phenomenon that randomly converts your crew into sentient paperclips for 3 days unless you solve a riddle written in the language of black holes (spoiler: it’s a palindrome).  
   - Discover **The Infinite Coffee Machine**, a device that brews perfect espresso but requires sacrificing one crew member’s sense of purpose per cup. Ethical dilemma: ☕️ or ☠️?  


**Tagline:** *"In a universe of infinite possibilities, yours is the most pointless."*
